# University Management System Ontology

## Project Overview
This project presents an OWL ontology for a **University Management System**, developed as a semester project for the subject **Knowledge Representation**. The ontology models the academic, administrative, and organizational structure of a university using formal semantic web standards.

The ontology is implemented in **OWL DL** and is designed to provide a structured and logically consistent representation of a university domain.

## Academic Context
- **Course:** Knowledge Representation  
- **Project Type:** Semester Project  
- **Ontology Domain:** University Management System  

---

## Ontology Features
- **20 Concepts (Classes)** representing core university entities
- **40 Roles (Object Properties)** modeling relationships between entities
- **Logical axioms** including:
  - Class hierarchies
  - Disjointness constraints
  - Existential restrictions
- Designed following **OWL DL** principles for formal knowledge representation

---

## Main Concepts
Some of the key classes defined in the ontology include:
- University
- Faculty
- Department
- Program
- Course
- Student
- UndergraduateStudent
- GraduateStudent
- Professor
- AdministrativeStaff

---

## Logical Modeling
The ontology encodes semantic constraints such as:
- Students must be enrolled in a program
- Students must take at least one course
- Professors must teach at least one course

These constraints formally define the expected structure of the domain.
